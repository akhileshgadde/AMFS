Does Vim support this feature?$
:set list in Vim will show whitespace. End of lines show as '$' and carriage returns usually show as '^M'.$

To disagree with the official answer$
n VIM, this should do the same thing as using the "-b" command line option. If you put this in your startup (i.e. .vimrc) file, it will always be in place for you.$
On many *nix systems, there is a "dos2unix" or "unix2dos" command that can process the file and correct any suspected line ending issues. If there is no problem with the line endings, the files will not be changed.$
The “Touring Club de France” (founded in 1890), is at the present time$
the largest Touring Association in the whole world. Its principal aim is$
to introduce France--admirable country and one of the loveliest on$
earth--to French people themselves and to foreigners.$
It seeks to develop travel in all its forms, on foot, on horseback, on$
bicycle, in carriage, motor, yacht, or railway, and soon in aeroplane.$
Every member of the Association receives a badge and an identity ticket$
free of charge, as also the “Revue Mensuelle” every month.$
Members have also the benefit of special prices in a certain number of$
affiliated hotels; and this holds good for the purchase of guide-books$
and Staff (Etat-major) maps, as well as those of the “Ministère de$
l’Intérieur,” the T. C. F., etc. They may insert notices regarding the$
sale or purchase of traveling requisites, in the “Revue” (1 fr. per$
line). The “Comité des Contentieux” is ready to give them counsel with$
regard to traveling, and 3,000 delegates in all the principal towns are$
able to give them advice and information about the curiosities of art or$
of nature in the neighborhood, as well as concerning the roads, hotels,$
motor-agents, garages, etc.$
Members are accorded free passage across the frontier for a bicycle or$
motor-bicycle. For a motor-car the Association gives a “Triptyque”$
ensuring free passage through the “douane,” etc.$
When the United States of America declared war on Germany, it was not$
known exactly what shape their intervention would take_--i.e., _if their$
help would be limited to aiding the Allies financially and industrially$
and tightening the blockade, or if they would take an active part in the$
military operations. Opinions on this point were much divided, and if$
many were in favour of an unrestricted participation in the war, others$
were for a more moderate programme._$
