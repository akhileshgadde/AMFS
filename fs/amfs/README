AMFS (Anti Malware File system) is developed as a stackable file system on top of wrapFS. The file system detects malicious files in the file system based on the pattern database specified at the mount time. The database can be dynamically updated using the custom designed "amfsctl" IOCTL calls. Any file contaning the malicious patterns is marked as bad and would not allow the users to access the bad files for any file operations.

COMPILING, MOUNTING and UNMOUNTING
-----------------------------------
i. The AMFS file system can be compiled using make and the module installed using the "install_module.sh" script in hw2-akgadde directory.
[root@vl154 hw2-akgadde]# make
[root@vl154 hw2-akgadde]# ./install_module.sh

ii. The File system is then mounted on top of any device using the mount command, like,
[root@vl154 hw2-akgadde]# mount -t amfs -o pattdb=../../pat.db rootdir/ /mnt/amfs/
-o pattdb=<pattern-file>, The file system reads the listed patterns in the pattern-file and stores then in it's database.

iii. The user program for AMFSCTL (IOCTL) program is already compiled in the Makefile of hw2-akgadde and an executable "amfsctl" is produced on successful compilation (in step 1).
AMFSCTL can be used to list the existing patterns, add a new pattern or delete an old pattern.
[root@vl154 hw2-akgadde]# ./amfsctl -l /mnt/amfs/ --> lists the stored patterns.
[root@vl154 hw2-akgadde]# ./amfsctl -a "New pattern" /mnt/amfs/ --> Adds "new pattern" to the database and updates the pattern-file.
[root@vl154 hw2-akgadde]# ./amfsctl -r "Old pattern" /mnt/amfs/ --> Removes an existing pattern from the database and updates the pattern-file.
- /mnt/amfs/ --> is the mount point. Should be replaced with your moint point.


FUNCTIONALITY
--------------
1. AMFSCTL (IOCTL):
- List option uses an additonal ioctl call (AMFSCTL_LEN_PATTERN) to find the length of the total pattern buffer. The user program then allocates adequate buffer and calls the AMFSCTL_LIST_PATTERN IOCTL call to get the patterns in a char buffer. The kernel module of the call copies all the patterns into a buffer and then does a copy_to_user() to copy to the user buffer.
- For patterns add and delete, a struct is passed to kernel that contains the length of the new pattern and the new pattern buffer. The kernel module does a copy_from_user() to copy the structure first and then again to copy the pattern buffer. The pattern database is first updated and then the complete pattern databse is then written to a temp file. The temp file is then atomically renamed as the original pattern-file. In the event of any error, the temp file is deleted and the original pattern file is preserved without corruption and an error returned to user for the IOCTL call.

2. IDENTIFYING GOOD/BAD FILES.
- When a file is being read/written in amfs_read/write, the buffer would be checked against all the patterns in the database and if it finds even a single matching pattern, the corresponding lower file's xattr, "user.amfs" would be marked as "Bad".
- The same logic of XATTR would be used even in amfs_readdir/filldir functions to discard display of BAD files in list commands. These functions are slightly modified versions of ECRYPTS readdir/filldir in fs/ecryptfs/file.c.
- 

- The same xattr, "user.amfs" would be used in readdir/filldir to identify 
- When opening a file, a check would be performed to see if the lower file's xattr, "user.amfs" is set to "Bad". If yes, the open would not be permitted and "Permission denied error" returned.

3. PROTECTING FILE XATTRS, "user.amfs" FROM USERS
- setxattr() has two flags - XATTR_CREATE and XATTR_REPLACE. I had added a new flag - XATTR_KERNEL to notify the AMFS_SETXATTR() function check whether the setxattr() function has been called from kernel/user land. If the user tries to modify the "user.amfs" xattr, the amfs_setattr() would throw an error - "Operation not permitted".

ASSUMPTIONS
------------
1. Each pattern size is a maximum of 4096 bytes. The pattern can be present in one or two pages but the siz eof each pattern doesn't exceed 4096 bytes.
2. Also, assumed that all the patterns are strings/ASCII characters.
3. The pattern database can be sepcified as relative/absolute path. The internal structure doesn't store the full path from the root directory and just stores the path given at the time of mount. Incase, you try to mount by giving a relative path from one location and run amfsctl calls from another location, the write would fail since the file create would take a path from the current location of AMFSCTL call.
