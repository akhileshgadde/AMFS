Does Vim support this feature?
:set list in Vim will show whitespace. End of lines show as '$' and carriage returns usually show as '^M'.
Does anyone know of a text editor on Linux that allows me to see line breaks and carriage returns? Does Vim support this feature?

To disagree with the official answer
n VIM, this should do the same thing as using the "-b" command line option. If you put this in your startup (i.e. .vimrc) file, it will always be in place for you.
On many *nix systems, there is a "dos2unix" or "unix2dos" command that can process the file and correct any suspected line ending issues. If there is no problem with the line endings, the files will not be changed.
The “Touring Club de France” (founded in 1890), is at the present time
the largest Touring Association in the whole world. Its principal aim is
to introduce France--admirable country and one of the loveliest on
earth--to French people themselves and to foreigners.
It seeks to develop travel in all its forms, on foot, on horseback, on
bicycle, in carriage, motor, yacht, or railway, and soon in aeroplane.
Every member of the Association receives a badge and an identity ticket
free of charge, as also the “Revue Mensuelle” every month.
Members have also the benefit of special prices in a certain number of
affiliated hotels; and this holds good for the purchase of guide-books
and Staff (Etat-major) maps, as well as those of the “Ministère de
l’Intérieur,” the T. C. F., etc. They may insert notices regarding the
sale or purchase of traveling requisites, in the “Revue” (1 fr. per
line). The “Comité des Contentieux” is ready to give them counsel with
regard to traveling, and 3,000 delegates in all the principal towns are
able to give them advice and information about the curiosities of art or
of nature in the neighborhood, as well as concerning the roads, hotels,
motor-agents, garages, etc.
Members are accorded free passage across the frontier for a bicycle or
motor-bicycle. For a motor-car the Association gives a “Triptyque”
ensuring free passage through the “douane,” etc.
When the United States of America declared war on Germany, it was not
known exactly what shape their intervention would take_--i.e., _if their
help would be limited to aiding the Allies financially and industrially
and tightening the blockade, or if they would take an active part in the
military operations. Opinions on this point were much divided, and if
many were in favour of an unrestricted participation in the war, others
were for a more moderate programme._
_When, at the beginning of April, 1917, President Wilson announced that
America’s help was to be unrestricted, the army of the United States
comprised some 9,000 officers and 200,000 men--a mere “drop in the
ocean,” as numbers go in modern warfare._
_Marshal Joffre’s visit to the United States aroused great enthusiasm;
the Conscription Bill was promptly passed, and the American War
Minister, Mr. Baker, and Marshal Joffre studied the organization and
transportation to France of a powerful expeditionary force._
_With wonderful rapidity recruits were raised, regiments formed, and
training camps built. French and British instructors co-operated
heartily, and, pending the creation of national war factories, France
equipped the first American army with her famous 75mm. guns, 155mm.
howitzers, machine-guns, etc._
_By March, 1918, the American Army had grown to more than 110,000
officers and 1,400,000 men, with sixteen immense training camps, besides
special technical schools and up-to-date aviation camps._
offered to place the whole of the forces under his command at the
disposal of Marshal Foch, who had just been made “Generalissimo of the
Allied Armies,” part of the new American army had already landed in
France, and several divisions were facing the enemy on the Lorraine
front._
_Meanwhile, the American Army continued to grow apace. In August,
thirty-two divisions of fighting troops, besides the staffs of the
non-combatant services--in all, more than 1,300,000 men--had landed in
France. In October this number had swelled to 1,700,000, while more than
2,000,000 men were training in American camps._
_The German U-boats failed to check America’s gigantic effort for the
“New Crusade,” and each month 250,000 American soldiers reached France,
with their arms, equipment, and baggage. It was estimated that in 1919
the American forces in the field would be numerically equal to the
entire German army._
_The victorious termination of the war prevented this formidable
American army from demonstrating its full strength, but that portion
which took part in the fighting gave ample proof of its mettle._
aviation volunteers had proved the fine qualities of the American
soldier. The expectations of the Allies were fulfilled; wherever they
fought the American expeditionary forces gave a good account of
themselves._ “We have come to kill and be killed, so let’s go ahead,”
_declared Generals Pershing and Bliss when, on March 28, they gallantly
offered to lead their troops into battle. And it is a fact that their
men did “go ahead” with a fine contempt for death._
